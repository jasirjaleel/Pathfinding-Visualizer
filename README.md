# Pathfinding Visualizer

## Description

Pathfinding Visualizer is a web-based tool for visualizing various pathfinding algorithms such as Dijkstra's Algorithm, A*, and Breadth First Search (BFS). It provides a grid-based interface where users can interactively create, modify, and visualize the shortest paths between a start and end node.

## Features

- Interactive grid-based interface for pathfinding
- Visualization of Dijkstra's, A*, and BFS algorithms
- Real-time animations for node exploration and pathfinding
- Options to clear walls, paths, and reset the board
- Adjustable speed for visualizations

## Technologies Used

- React
- JavaScript
- CSS/SCSS
- Lucide Icons
